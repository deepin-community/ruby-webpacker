Description: Use webpack to manage app-like JavaScript modules in Rails
 Webpacker makes it easy to use the JavaScript pre-processor and bundler
 webpack 4.x.x+ to manage application-like JavaScript in Rails. It
 coexists with the asset pipeline, as the primary purpose for webpack is
 app-like JavaScript, not images, CSS, or even JavaScript Sprinkles.
